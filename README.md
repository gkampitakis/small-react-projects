This is a repository for learning and practising concepts in React such as `Hooks` and `Testing`.

It follows this [React Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo) and extends functionality in some projects.

You can [visit](https://gkampitakis.github.io/small-react-projects) and see the result of this repo.

## Usage

Install dependencies: `npm run install`

Run tests: `npm run test`

Run it locally: `npm run start`

## Contents

-   You can find projects under `/projects` folder.
-   You can find tests under `*.spec.ts` files.
-   Some commonly used hooks are under `/src/hooks`.
