This is a repository for learning and practising concepts in React such as `Hooks` and `Testing`.

It follows this [React Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo) and extends functionality in some projects.

You can [visit](https://gkampitakis.github.io/small-react-projects) and see the result of this repo.

## Usage

Install dependencies: `npm run install`

Run tests: `npm run test`

Run it locally: `npm run start`

## Contents

-   You can find projects under `/projects` folder.
-   You can find tests under `*.spec.ts` files.
-   Some commonly used hooks are under `/src/hooks`.

### Notes: 

- Project Cocktails

  On this project a context is used in order to inject data between components and share functions. Also there are some nested routes for navigating to `/cocktails/details` and `/cocktails/about`. One issue that was noticed is that the context gets re-rendered on every navigation. Not sure if this intended or can be resolved, the only solution I found is moving the context provider wrapping outside of the Router.
